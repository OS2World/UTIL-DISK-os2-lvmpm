:p.:hp2."Cannot create primary partition":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.It is not possible to create a primary partition using the requested
parameters.
:p.The most likely cause of this error is that you attempted to create a
primary partition in an illegal location. According to the basic rules of
MBR style disk partitioning, a primary partition cannot be created between
two logical partitions.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.Make sure you are not trying to create a primary partition between two
logical partitions.
:p.This could also indicate an internal program error in partition-creation
logic, so you may wish to contact support as well.

:h2 x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100% res=12012.Error code 12
:p.:hp2."Too many primary partitions":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.On a single disk drive there is a maximum of either four primary
partitions, or three primary partitions plus one or more logical partitions.
This error is generated if you attempt to exceed this limit.
:p.(Keep in mind that IBM Boot Manager, if installed, occupies one primary
partition.)
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.You may have to re-think the layout of your disk drive in order to conform
with the above limit.
:p.This error could also indicate an internal program error
in partition-creation logic, so you may wish to contact support as well.

.* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:h2 x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100% res=12013.Error code 13
:p.:hp2."Cannot create logical partition":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.It is not possible to create the requested logical partition. According
to MBR drive geometry rules&colon.
:ul.
:li.All logical partitions on a disk drive must be adjacent.
:li.Logical partitions cannot be created on a disk which already contains four
primary partitions.
:eul.
:p.This error probably means that you have attempted to violate these rules.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.You may have to re-think the layout of your disk drive in order to conform
with the above limit.
:p.This error could also indicate an internal program error
in partition-creation logic, so you may wish to contact support as well.

.* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:h2 x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100% res=12014.Error code 14
:p.:hp2."Requested size is too large":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.The requested size of the volume or partition is too large for the available
space.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.Try reducing the requested size and trying again.
:p.In addition, since LVMPM should not be allowing you to request an invalid
volume size in the first place, please contact support if you encounter this
error message.

.* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
:h2 x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100% res=12015.Error code 15
:p.:hp2."System does not report INT13X boot compatibility":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.Normally, &os2. supports booting beyond the 1024 cylinder limit of a
hard disk drive (which generally translates to just over 8 GB from the
beginning of the drive). This capability is referred to as the &osq.INT13
Extensions&csq. (INT13X). However, it depends on your computer's BIOS
supporting this feature as well.

:p.If you receive this error message, it means that you have encountered the
following combination of circumstances&colon.
:ol.
:li.You are attempting to either install IBM Boot Manager, create a bootable
volume, or make an existing volume or partition bootable; and
:li.The partition, volume, or Boot Manager location in question extends past
the 1024 cylinder limit on the current hard disk drive; and
:li.The volume management engine is reporting that your computer does not
support INT13X.
:eol.

:p.Some older computers do not support INT13X, and therefore are not capable of
booting from volumes or partitions which extend beyond the 1024 cylinder limit.
:hp2.However:ehp2., receiving this error message does not necessarily mean that
this is the case for your system.

:p.Even on computers which do support INT13X, it may be necessary to rewrite your
Master Boot Record (MBR) in order to enable this feature. See below for details.

:p.Finally, some hard disks may be mis-reporting their true size. (Some IDE hard
disks do this in order to maintain compatibility with older computer BIOSes.)
Both the AHCI (OS2AHCI.ADD) and Enhanced IDE (DANIS506.ADD) drivers attempt to
detect the true size of the hard disk; however, in some circumstances this can
cause the above error to appear. A possible workaround in this case is to reboot
using the Standard IDE driver (IBM1S506.ADD), and try the operation again. See
below for details.

:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.This error does not necessarily mean that your computer does not support INT13X.
The volume management engine may simply require your hard disk's Master Boot Record
(MBR) to be rewritten.  If this is the case, the problem can usually be resolved by
doing the following&colon.
:ol.
:li.Make sure the first hard disk is selected in the physical view panel, then
go to the :hp1.System:ehp1. menu and choose :hp1.Rewrite MBR:ehp1..
:li.Save your changes and then close LVMPM.
:li.Shut down and reboot the computer.
:li.After the computer comes back up, start LVMPM and try again.
:eol.

:p.If this does not work, you may also try rebooting using the Standard IDE driver
(IBM1S506.ADD) instead of the AHCI (OS2AHCI.ADD) or Enhanced IDE (DANIS506.ADD)
drivers. This disables the IDE disk size-detection mechanism which has been known
to cause this error. Alternatively, you can use the Enhanced IDE driver and specify
the parameters :hp2./A&colon.0 /U&colon.0 /!SETMAX:ehp2. in its load statement
(available either through the boot options menu on the &os2. installation
media, or else by editing CONFIG.SYS on an installed &os2. system).

:p.If the above does not work, you may have to settle for creating all bootable
partitions, and/or installing IBM Boot Manager, near the beginning of the disk(s).

:h2 x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100% res=12016.Error code 16
:p.:hp2."Partition alignment error":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.This error can occur if the disk drive's partition table is improperly
formatted in some way. Certain partitioning tools can cause this problem.
In particular, many Linux installation utilities and/or partition managers
tend to write data to the partition table in a way that the Logical Volume
Manager cannot properly interpret.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.There is no easy solution to this problem.  The best remedy is to avoid
it in the first place&colon. in general, you are advised to avoid creating or
modifying partitions using Linux-based tools or installers, and instead create
your partitions using &os2. or other (non-Linux) operating systems.
:p.If you do encounter this error, there are a couple of things you can try.
The most extreme solution is to delete all partitions on the disk and recreate
them using LVM. However, this action would erase all data on the hard disk,
which could be undesirable.
:p.The best alternative is to use a partition-management tool which is capable
of recognizing the problem and repairing it. One such tool is :hp1.DFSee:ehp1.
from FSYS Software, available at http&colon.//www.dfsee.com/.

:p.:hp2."Incorrect volume type":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.The selected volume type is not valid for the requested operation.
For instance, you might have tried to mark an advanced (LVM) volume as bootable
or startable.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.Select a different volume before trying the operation again.
:p.Alternatively, you might be able to delete the volume and recreate it as a
different type (e.g. as a standard instead of an advanced volume). However,
doing this will cause any data currently on the volume to be lost.

third-party boot management software on your system, you will need to use that
software to make this volume's partition bootable.
:p.Alternatively, use a different volume (one which consists of a primary
partition) instead.

:h2 x=left y=bottom width=100% height=100% res=12043.Error code 43
:p.:hp2."ExtendFS operation failed":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.The volume management engine tried to add a new partition to the selected
volume, but was unable to do so.
:p.Expanding a volume by adding a new partition to it is only possible if
certain conditions are met. Specifically, the existing volume must be an
advanced (LVM type) volume, and must be either unformatted, or formatted using
the Journaled File System (JFS).
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.Ensure that the volume you are trying to expand is an advanced (LVM) volume.
Also ensure that the volume is either unformatted, or is formatted as JFS.

:p.:hp2."Cannot open log file":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.The LVM engine logging feature could not be activated because the target
log file could not be opened. The drive may be read-only, in which case
logging will not be possible.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.This program does not make use of the logging feature; therefore, this
message probably represents an internal program error. Please contact support.

:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.The LVM engine logging feature tried to write to the log file, but failed
for some reason. The drive may be full, or the log file may have been corrupted
or deleted.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.This program does not support the logging feature; therefore, this message
probably represents an internal program error. Please contact support.

:p.The LVM engine tried to check for removable media devices, but the operation
failed for some reason.

:p.:hp2."An unsupported partitioning scheme is in use on ...":ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.There is a disk drive connected to the system which uses a non-MBR-based
partitioning scheme such as GPT or LUKS. Such disk drives are not supported by
LVM. For safety, all LVM engine functions are disabled when such a disk is
detected.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.Remove the non-MBR disk drive from the system, or erase its contents completely,
before trying again. Normally, the disk drive in question should be indicated in the
error message. If not, try running a diagnostic tool (such as :hp1.DFSee:ehp1. from
FSys Software) to get more information.

:p.:hp2.There are no bootable OS/2 volumes defined.  Do you really want to exit?:ehp2.
:p.
:p.:hp5.Explanation:ehp5.
:p.There is no &os2. volume marked as either bootable or startable.

:p.If you have &os2. installed on your system and this message appears, it
indicates that your &os2. system is not presently functional.

:p.
:p.:hp5.Suggested Action:ehp5.
:p.If you are in the process of installing (or are about to install)
&os2., you must ensure that you have at least one volume that meets the
criteria listed above.

:p.If &os2. is already installed on your system and you wish to be able
to use it, then you should make sure that the &os2. boot volume is
properly bootable (as described above) and has a drive letter assigned.
