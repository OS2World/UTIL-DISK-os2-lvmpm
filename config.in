# CVS DIRECTORY SETUP
# -------------------

# CVS_WORK_ROOT: the root of your CVS tree
# (the parent dir of "xworkplace" and "xwphelpers")
!ifndef CVS_WORK_ROOT
CVS_WORK_ROOT = g:\netlabs\cvs
!endif

# XWPDIR: name of the directory this file resides in
# (subdirectory of CVS_WORK_ROOT).
# This will usually be xworkplace (the CVS repository
# name), unless you chose a different name.
XWPDIR = xworkplace

# XWPHELPERSDIR: name of the directory the xwphelpers
# resides in (subdirectory of CVS_WORK_ROOT).

# INCLUDE AND LIB SETUP
# ---------------------

# Starting with V0.9.12, we no longer use the default
# INCLUDE and LIB paths. Instead, we specify all
# directories directly on the command lines, so we
# need to know where your toolkit and compiler things
# are.

# TKBASE: the main Toolkit directory.
# This must be the parent of the "h" and "lib"
# directories with the include files and libraries.
!ifndef TKBASE
TKBASE = e:\development\os2tk45
!endif

# VACBASE: the main directory of your IBM
# VisualAge C++ installation. Only 3.0.8 has
# been tested so far.
# This must be the parent of the "include" and "lib"
# directories with the include files and libraries.
!ifndef VACBASE
VACBASE = e:\development\ibmcpp
!endif

# DDKBASE: your DDK "base" directory.
# Not used by the regular makefiles, unless you
# want to build XWorkplace Security.
# DDKBASE = e:\development\DDK\base

# SESBASE: your SES "base" directory.
# Not used by the regular makefiles, unless you
# want to build XWorkplace Security.
# SESBASE = K:\libs\security
