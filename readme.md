# Logical Volume Manager for PM (LVMPM)

LVMPM is a native PM application designed to replace the Java-based IBM LVMGUI
interface. It has been designed as part of the objectives (specifically, item
2) defined by the LVM redesign project:
http://www.altsan.org/os2/toolkits/lvm/redesign/

## Building

Building LVMPM requires the LVM Toolkit (header files and lvm.lib) from
http://www.altsan.org/os2/toolkits/lvm/

It also uses the XWorkplace Helpers library; in this case the necessary header
and library files are included in the repository here.
