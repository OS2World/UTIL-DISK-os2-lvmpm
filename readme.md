Logical Volume Manager for Presentation Manager (LVMPM)
=======================================================

LVMPM is a native PM application designed to replace the Java-based IBM LVMGUI
interface.  It has been designed as part of the objectives defined by the LVM 
redesign project: http://www.altsan.org/os2/toolkits/lvm/redesign/


Building
--------

In addition to the standard OS/2 Toolkit, building LVMPM requires the LVM 
Toolkit (header and library files) from http://www.altsan.org/os2/toolkits/lvm/

It also uses the XWorkplace Helpers library; in this case the necessary header
and library files are included in the repository here.  

The included Makefile is for the IBM C Compiler or VisualAge C++.  Using the 
prebuilt `helpers.lib` specifically requires ICC version 3.65; to build using
3.08, replace `helpers.lib` with `helpers.308` or else rebuild the `xwphelpers`
target using 3.08.  Note that building `helpers.lib` also requires the ACPI
Toolkit for OS/2, in addition to the XWPHelpers sources from NetLabs.

Building with GCC or OpenWatcom is not tested or supported. 

To build LVMPM: 

1. Copy `local.inc.sample` to `local.inc` and edit the paths as appropriate for
   your system.  Note that only the first item is required to simply build
   `lvmpm.exe`; the other items are only needed for rebuilding `helpers.lib`.

2. Make sure your environment is configured for the IBM C Compiler, and the
   OS/2 Toolkit (4.5) is also installed and configured.

3. Run `nmake32` to build a release binary, or `nmake32 DEBUG=1` for a debug
   build.  The English language NLS files (in `001\`) are built by default.
